# Capstone Project – Robot Motion Planning
## Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze

### Description
This project is inspired from an event ‘Micromouse Competitions’ where a small robot navigates a maze and learns the shortest path to the center of that maze. The competition originated in the 1970s and is a popular event held around the globe. The project deals with the basic concepts of motion planning in artificial intelligence and is an attempt to apply machine learning in the field of autonomous robotics.

### Project Requirements
* Python 3.6
* Numpy

### Files
* robot.py - This script establishes the robot class. The main code for the robot with all the algorithms is available here.
* maze.py - This script contains functions for constructing the maze and for checking for walls upon robot movement or sensing.
* showmaze.py - This script will be used to create a visual demonstration of what a maze looks like and to display the path taken by the robot.
* tester.py - This script will be run to test the robot’s ability to navigate mazes by visualizing the maze and 

* mazes – Folder containing four maze files upon which to test the robot. Files are named  as test_maze_##.txt . The ## is to be replaced by 01, 02, 03 & 04.
* images - Folder containing images for turtle graphics to visualize the robot and the goal.

* Capstone Report : Documentation for the Capstone project
* Capstone Proposal : Capstone proposal for the project

### To run the tester:
python tester.py mazes\test_maze_01.txt
